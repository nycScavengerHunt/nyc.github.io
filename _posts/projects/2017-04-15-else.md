<p>South Street Seaport!</p>

<p>While this place has not played an important role in our collective memory, it does remind me of how we like to go on small adventures to a new part of the city - always something I've enjoyed doing with you. Since I did not take any pictures when we were down here, instead look at some nice wilderness - I couldn't find a clue to match any of them in the city.</p>

The next location spans many, many miles in a longstrip that you have traveled before (not just by walking, and note that cars can't come here).  Head to where the pavement looks down on a nice beach before it takes a turn to the right and a maze, and near the plants you will find what you seek.
