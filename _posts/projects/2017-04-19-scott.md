<p>Breweries!</p>
<p></p>
It feels like in recent times we have really taken to visiting new and intersting breweries, going on long walks and trying their dankest IPAs.  I think this has been one of our greatest decisions and there is no one else I would rather brewery hop with.  I look forward to visiting all of the breweries in NYC with you.

The next clues are related in a way that they both celebrate the greatest expressions of human kind.  In Queens head to a house full of weird and current treasures, we have only been here once before its sister branch a couple times.  For Brooklyn head to a more delicous form of expression that we have devoured several times - quite recently in fact.
