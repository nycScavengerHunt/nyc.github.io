<p>What a place, moving in I knew this building would really change my life but I had not idea it would be by this much.  From our crazy themed parties to studying and watching movies, I always had a blast heading to your room or having you down to mine, it was such a goofy and exhilirating time.</p>

<p>We stay on the theme of important buildings, although not in a cultural sense.  While there are 5 flights it's not an airport (or our apartment).</p>
