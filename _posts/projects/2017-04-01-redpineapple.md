<p>Happy Birthday! Well one day after your birthday. It is warm, and I have not done this in a while, so why not ... Let's go on a Scavenger Hunt</p>
<p></p>
<p>It works like this: Each clue (like this) will point you to a destination where you will find a note with a short phrase on it.  This short phrase become the after slash part of the url for the next clue!  And don't worry, this time I made it easy with no rhymes and a picture highlighting the location of the note.  It will be a fun walk really, not a hunt, so come on let's go!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your first clue is a place that first arranged our relationship, and just last year helped build our home</p>
<p>Like a good friend it always has a bathroom handy</p>
<p>But don't go too far! You'll be nearby when you are surrounded by blooms!</p>
