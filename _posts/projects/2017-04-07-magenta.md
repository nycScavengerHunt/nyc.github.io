<p> I'm not sure how romantic this spot was when we were just getting together, but I know that in the past few months a favorite date of mine has been walking across the park to buy some groceries and eating the peanut butter cups.  I look forward to many more of these simple dates in the years to come (as long as there is minimal tofu that is).</p>

<p>The theme for the next clue is not a location, but rather an activity that does go back to our beginnings, specifically the first summer.  As a metaphor for this head to a nearby place with many pages and words, and look for an item relating to activity I want you to reminisce.</p>
