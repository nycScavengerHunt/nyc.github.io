<p>Grand Central!</p>
<p>It was always a perfect day when I could walk up to grand central and meet you getting off the train from New Milford, it's a shame that I could never ever figure out which track or staircase you would get off at.  When you had to go it was always sad, although those moments make times like today that we live together even better</p>
<p></p>
<p>You don't have to go far to get to the next clue, although it is hard to nail a timepoint for this one. We first went there and ate a salad before a big date, recently you have led your own expeditions there, and in between it has been a midtown rest stop - even if we have never actually sat on that lawn.</p>
