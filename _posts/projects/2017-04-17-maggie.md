<p>Ferry!</p>
<p></p>
We have only taken the ferry a few times but each time was really fun (except for the waiting).  Looking back I like to think of it as us being a little goofy doing the weird thing just because it's there. I am also reminded of how we have spent some time on the water and at the beach, from Rhode Island to Guadeloupe and in the future maybe even the Rockaways - all great vacations.

This is where things get interesting.  I thought you would be getting tired of me calling all the shots so instead it is time to chose your own adventure: Queens of Williamsburg. For Queens take the ferry to a large sign that has just been altered, stand back to appreticate it and look near an oasis of greenery.  For Brooklyn head to Williamsburg and into a park with a logiscal name, when heading back  into the neighborhood say hi to the borkers on your way.
