<p>Pepsi-Cola or ER Park!</p>
<p></p>
While was have not spent to much time at either location I think they both serve as a good reminder of how unlike some New Yorkers we like to get out of our borough and see some new sites.  Either checking out a fresh park along the water or going to celebrate the fourth of july - both great times.

The next two clues have the same exact theme but they are in diffrent locations.  We have been to the LIC version more often, on several happy hours that were hardware themed, the one in Brooklyn is better known by the masses.
