<p>Home Depot!</p>

<p>Over this location we had cause to send our very first texts a full five years ago.  Then just one year ago we shopped together for items to move in together.  And I'm sure we'll be back for another soap, or free bathroom</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next clue switches from a place of the long-term building to one of quick comings and goings.  At first we visited for the grandeur, but a couple years ago it served as an important link to the north.  When you get there don't forget to stare up at the stars!</p>
