<p>Whole Foods!</p>
<p></p>
While we have not spent too much time in this establishment, we have bought some good cookies here.  In general I like to think about all the times we have cooked dinner together from the fancy chiliaquiles to the normal quesadilla, someone cooks and the other does the dishes, it's always the highlight of my day sitting down to dinner with you.
<p></p>
The next clue should be in a logical spot, for after dinner there is dessert.
