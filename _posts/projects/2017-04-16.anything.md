<p>Bike Path!</p>
<p></p>
While this particular location has served us for several runs, for the point of looking back (and forward) I like to think about the biking.  From the Lake Shore Drive to RAGBRAI and just to Bushwick  we have done some fun bike rides together.  I am sorry when I go to fast, I am just too busy having a blast with you.
<p></p>
At this point don't seek a place (well again you do need to find the clue) but another form of transportation.  Not a typical one, but one that is fun and even the funner than that because it is close by.
