<p>Go Bus!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Those bus rides were long, but felt even longer. Thank you for taking the weekend to come visit me all those times, back then it seemed like my life ran in two week circles.  It's so good that is all over and I can walk two streets instead of hundreds of miles - hoping to get no one sitting next to me. </p>

<p>It's time to walk, a place that is no longer in the past but rather a still visited location for food and some libations (wine). I hope you're still full however, otherise the trip to the grand finale might delay us, instead let's look for a nice bottle.  </p>
