<p>Bryant Park!</p>
<p></p>
<p>That first date I was so excited to do something fancy, and official with you but the show in your eyes was far better than anything on the broadway stage.  I always like coming back thinking about that time, and in general just taking a break from one of our long walks.  When I am here I also see the big library and am reminded how smart you are (plus that lions in front are cats and you like cats).</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the next clue continue in the same direction, although this time it won't be to a park.  With all the bright lights around you may be blinded, but that's OK because you only need your nose to get to where I want to take us.  The person at the counter knows us well and the clue is nearby.</p>
