<p>Cheesecake!</p>
<p></p>
I remember the first time in the dorms wanting to make a cake but being confined by the lack of ovens, how it turned out a soup but you still said it was delicous.  You have eaten many cheesecakes thereafter and I am sorry that you ended up liking carrot cake more, but you were always such a sweety going through with a smile anyway.
<p></p>
Spoiler alert I have the clue, but the night is not over, we now head to a place full of rowers but instead of picking up an oar yourself find a glass instead.
