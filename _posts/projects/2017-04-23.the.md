<p>The Boat House!</p>

I always have a grand time when we dress up fancy and get a cocktail or two, from the time in DC or Saratoga or more.  I have always passed this place and thought it would be a good idea to try it out, and I hope you have thought the same, and now when you run with Lorena you can have a nice story to tell of an outing and a drink.

The night is yours bunny!  We can stay and party in the park or head home and sleep.  But before you do let me take you to one more stop and get a silly gift.
