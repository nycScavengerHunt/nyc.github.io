<p>Fourth Street</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the beginnings of us just seeing each other at Blink together, known at that time as classmates not yet anything else.  To us later starting a walk with a lattee, and then me coming back from Bobst and calling you to hear about your day before saying good night this street has all of the memories.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This may be the shortest trip to the next clue yet, just head to the party park and continue until you hear the sound of barking.</p>
