<p>Washington Square Park</p>
<p></p>
<p>While we didn't really discover this park our first year, in the remainin years of Cooper we sure seemed to take advantage of it.  From a place to bring a friend, a place to revel while a little tipsy, or a place to just sit on a bench and picnic we did it all and had a blast.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike every other place we will go to today, this place we have only been to once, and in fact I don't think it's the same place it was back then.  It was a place for firsts, and also an Italian delicacy.  </p>
