<p>First Date Pizza!</p>
<p></p>
<p>I remember that I wanted to get you a cab and you would have none of it, so instead we walked.  The place looked nice, and you gorgeous, I don't even remember the food.  We have had many pizza and other meals since, but this was where it all began.</p>
<p></p>
One of our last first dates took us to this span, luckily I will save you the walk this time.  Instead just look around at the base and try not to get suckered into buying any of those silly pictures.
