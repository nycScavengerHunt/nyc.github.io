<p>Brooklyn Bridge!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps that lock trick really was magic, after all it seems like I have been locked to you ever since.  But we have had many other grand times on this bridge as well, from running to showing it to friends and even just getting to Brooklyn.</p>
<p></p>
But this time we will have to try not to walk that long mile and instead stay in Manhattan.  Colonists used to come here and get on a boat wishing they had a bridge, we came here and dined recently after I suggested it many atime.  The area is large so I will narrow it down further: for the clue look for a park named for a big ship no longer with us.
