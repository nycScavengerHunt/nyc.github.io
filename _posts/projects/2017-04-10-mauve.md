<p>I remember the first time I unlocked the doors with you in tough, you seem underwhelmed but now looking back I am overwhelmed with all the memories.  From the parties we had and meals we cooked in the tiny kitchen to the launching pad it offered to the east village and beyond ... the only thing missing in that place was you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The next clue is not at one spot (well literally it is) but three!  This is the spot to get you caffeine, or raise your heart rate more naturally before ending up in a large atrium dedicated to the scholarly arts.  Head off from there into another reading place and find a product that you are very familiar with from its origins to where you will pick it up.  </p>
