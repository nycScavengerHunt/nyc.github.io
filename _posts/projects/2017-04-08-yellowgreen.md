<p>Letter Writing (@Strand)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some people might have though I was crazy for writing all of you those leters that summer, including myself, but it became the favorite part of my day and I think set up this amazing relationship we have today.  I don't know what you thought of them but I always loved getting your words in the mail, thank you!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Before there were letters there was a physical location, from 8 to 9 or 9 to 8 we would take trips within.  The building is on the corner, but the clue is in the small park, that you can't get it, nearby.</p>
